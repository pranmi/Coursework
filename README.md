# Coursework
A collection of courework/projects done for classes

## Final Projects:
### [Database Design (Library Database System)](https://github.com/pranmi/CS6360Project)
Worked alongside a classmate to impliment a simple library database system. Started from specifications to design an *Extended Entity Relation* model, mapped it to a *Relational Model*, and normalized functional dependancies.
Then Used the final models to impliment the specific tables and queries in **OracleDBMS**


### [Computer Graphics (Interactive Solar System Rendering)](https://github.com/Ryanjones0911/UTD-Graphics-Final-Project)
Worked alongside a team of three to impliment a rendering of the Solar System using **WebGL** with the **JavaScript Three.js** library with **Node.js** as the runtime.
Personally implimented:
- Time scale (speed up and slow down) controlls
- Clickable objects (camera tracking and showing an info panel formatted with css)
- Ellipsoidal motion for a comet with a simulated comet trail
- Dynamic shader for the sun utilizing brownian motion to mimic the surface of the sun

### [Intelligent System Analysis (Deep Learning Model)] (https://github.com/pranmi/Coursework/tree/main/Matlab%20deep%20learning)
Created a small **Deep Learning** model to predict a car's safetly based on different attributes.
Implimented the model in **MatLab** using a batch gradient descent algorithm with a few layers of hidden units.
Experimented with different reularization parameters as well as hidden node pruning to improve effeciency.
